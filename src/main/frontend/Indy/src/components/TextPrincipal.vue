<h1>ISMAEL AS INDIANA JONES</h1>

<P>Ever since watching Raiders of the Lost Ark as a kid, Ismael has been fascinated by Indiana Jones as a film character. The film provided two hours of sheer, mind-blowing entertainment that would take the world by storm.<br>

When the film was over and the lights brought everybody back to reality, Ismael felt that he had been part of something very special. On his way back home, dreamy and absent-minded, he tried to slowly digest the magnificent spectacle that he had just experienced.
Raiders was just the beginning. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom would follow only three years later…and then, of course, The Last Crusade and Crystal Skull. <br>

The appeal of the Indiana Jones character is unquestionable. It is simply iconic and manages to reach all audiences – young and old. This, of course, has a lot to do with Harrison Ford’s charisma - but also with Indy’s determination and witty sense of humour. He is the courageous-yet-relatable adventurer who takes us to exotic lands and fires up our imagination. Who didn’t ever want to be Indy at some point in their lives?<br>

Indiana Jones was named the greatest movie character of all time… after thousands of film fans cast their votes via the Empire magazine, back in 2015. James Bond came only second.<br>

All throughout these years, fans all over the world have been fascinated not only by the storylines – but also by Indy’s iconic gear. Ismael was of course one of them. <br>
Over the years he has been dressing up as Indy, bringing joy to many people. Whether it is at corporate events, promotional assignments or charity galas, the ‘Indy’ in him takes over and never disappoints. <br><br>
