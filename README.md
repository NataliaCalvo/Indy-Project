# ISMAEL AS INDIANA JONES

A personal webpage for the Indiana Jones' cosplayer: Ismael Rionda.

Ismael needed a personal website before the release of the movie "Indiana jones and the dial of destiny" in order to show his cosplayer work and offer himself for hiring.

He needed several sections: Home, Main text, Biography, Gallery and Bookings as well as a contact form and a list of his past events.
